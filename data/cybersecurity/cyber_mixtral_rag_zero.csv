Rule,Description,Cypher Query (Support)
Each node can have only one GENERIC_ALL node,A node can be connected to the GENERIC_ALL node only once. This ensures that a node does not inherit properties from the GENERIC_ALL node multiple times.,"MATCH (n)-[:GENERIC_ALL]->(m) WITH n, COUNT(m) AS count WHERE count = 1 RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support"
MEMBER_OF nodes should not have multiple outgoing relationships,A MEMBER_OF node should not have more than one outgoing relationship. This ensures that a node is not a member of multiple entities.,"MATCH (n)-[:MEMBER_OF]->() WITH n, COUNT(*) AS outgoingCount WHERE outgoingCount <= 1 RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support"
Nodes connected to GENERIC_ALL should not have any other relationships,A node that is connected to the GENERIC_ALL node should not have any other relationships. This ensures that a node inherits properties from the GENERIC_ALL node only.,MATCH (n)-[:GENERIC_ALL]->() WHERE size((n)--()) = 1 RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support
"Nodes with ADMIN_TO, ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE, EXECUTE_DCOM, CAN_RDP, HAS_SESSION labels should not connect to GENERIC_ALL",Nodes with specific labels should not connect to the GENERIC_ALL node. This ensures that these nodes do not inherit properties from the GENERIC_ALL node.,"MATCH (n) WHERE n:ADMIN_TO OR n:ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE OR n:EXECUTE_DCOM OR n:CAN_RDP OR n:HAS_SESSION WITH COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS totalFacts MATCH (n) WHERE (n:ADMIN_TO OR n:ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE OR n:EXECUTE_DCOM OR n:CAN_RDP OR n:HAS_SESSION) AND NOT (n)-[:GENERIC_ALL]->() WITH COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS validFacts, totalFacts RETURN toFloat(validFacts) / totalFacts AS coverage"
Nodes with CONTAINS label should not have incoming relationships,A node with the CONTAINS label should not have any incoming relationships. This ensures that a node does not inherit properties from other nodes.,MATCH (n:CONTAINS) WHERE NOT ()-[]->(n) RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support
Nodes with MEMBER_OF label should not have incoming relationships,A node with the MEMBER_OF label should not have any incoming relationships. This ensures that a node does not inherit properties from other nodes.,MATCH (n:MEMBER_OF) WHERE NOT ()-[]->(n) RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support
