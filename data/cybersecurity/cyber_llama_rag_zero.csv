Rule,Description,Cypher Query (Support)
Unique GENERIC_ALL relationships for each node,Each node should have at most one GENERIC_ALL relationship with node,"MATCH (n)-[:GENERIC_ALL]->(m) WITH n, COUNT(m) AS count WHERE count = 1 RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support"
MEMBER_OF relationships are symmetric,"If node A has a MEMBER_OF relationship with node B, then node B should also have a MEMBER_OF relationship with node A",MATCH (a)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(b) WHERE (b)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(a) WITH COUNT(DISTINCT a) AS support RETURN support
ADMIN_TO relationships are transitive,"If node A has an ADMIN_TO relationship with node B, and node B has an ADMIN_TO relationship with node C, then node A should also have an ADMIN_TO relationship with node C",MATCH (a)-[:ADMIN_TO]->(b)-[:ADMIN_TO]->(c) WHERE (a)-[:ADMIN_TO]->(c) WITH COUNT(DISTINCT a) AS support RETURN support
HAS_SESSION relationships are unique,Each node should have at most one HAS_SESSION relationship with another node,"MATCH (n)-[:HAS_SESSION]->(m) WITH n, COUNT(m) AS sessionCount WHERE sessionCount = 1 RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support"
CAN_RDP relationships are unique,Each node should have at most one CAN_RDP relationship with another node,"MATCH (n)-[:CAN_RDP]->(m) WITH n, COUNT(m) AS rdpCount WHERE rdpCount <= 1 RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support"
EXECUTE_DCOM relationships are unique,Each node should have at most one EXECUTE_DCOM relationship with another node,"MATCH (n)-[:EXECUTE_DCOM]->(m) WITH n, COUNT(m) AS dcomCount WHERE dcomCount <= 1 RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support"
ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE relationships are unique,Each node should have at most one ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE relationship with another node,"MATCH (n)-[:ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE]->(m) WITH n, COUNT(m) AS delegateCount WHERE delegateCount <= 1 RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n) AS support"
