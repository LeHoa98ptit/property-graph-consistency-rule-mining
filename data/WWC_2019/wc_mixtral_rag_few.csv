Unique Relationship Endpoints,"Each relationship should have unique nodes at its ends. This means that a relationship cannot connect the same two nodes more than once, regardless of the relationship type.","
        MATCH (n1)-[r]->(n2)
        WITH n1, n2, TYPE(r) AS rel_type, COUNT(r) AS count

        RETURN n1 AS start_node, n2 AS end_node, rel_type, count

Valid Relationship Types,"The relationship types should match the node types they are connecting. For example, a 'PLAYED_IN' relationship should only connect a Person node to a Match node.","

Unique Player Representatives,Each 'Player' node should have only one 'REPRESENTS' relationship to a 'Person' node. This ensures that each player is represented by only one person.,"

Player Minute On Consistency,"For 'PLAYED_IN' relationships with a 'minuteOn' property, the sum of 'minuteOn' for a player in a match should not exceed the total match minutes.",
Player Type Consistency,"For 'PLAYED_IN' relationships, if a 'type' property is present, it should be consistent for all relationships of a player in a match.","
